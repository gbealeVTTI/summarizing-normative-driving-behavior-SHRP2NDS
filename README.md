## SHRP2 Driving Behavior Distributions

The SHRP2 NDS data set includes driver and vehicle data on 3,400+ drivers and over 5.4 millions trips, equating to around 35 million miles driven across the US. To help investigate and visualize the driving trends for speed, speeding, follow distance, headway, and distance from center values across the SHRP2 NDS, these interactive visualization tools have been developed for each of the driving behaviors. Specifically, these driving behaviors can be viewed and filtered based on driver age and gender, vehicle class, and other roadway characteristics, such as speed limit and roadway type information. 

The goal of this project is to allow users to better understand and investigate how driving behavior changes relative to driver, vehicle, or roadway characteristics. The tools created also demonstrate a method of, one, breaking down the large number of vehicle trips contained in the NDS data into time series data, extracting vehicle and roadway characteristics, and then grouping and summarizing across trips and driver demographic information to create a large summary dataset; and, two, breaking that resultant dataset back into queriable datasets of manageable size for the interactive investigation and summary of a particular driving behavior aspect via the interactive visualization tool.

This work was funded by the [National Surface Transportation Safety Center for Excellence (NSTSCE)](https://www.vtti.vt.edu/national/nstsce/index.html)
